My base .h/.c Files for setting up a Graphic application.  Create Views, load IFF(ILBM) files, grab images from IFF(ILBM) Files, Set up GELS and creating BOBS and VSprites

Note - the format of getting images from .iff files is not compatible with VSprites and SimpleSprites
It only works with bobs and other bitplane images
